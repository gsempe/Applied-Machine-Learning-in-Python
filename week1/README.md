### Install the environment

Course advice to install all needed libraries via https://www.continuum.io/downloads

#### Download the OSX command line installer

From https://www.continuum.io/downloads

```sh
$ # For Python 2.7
$ curl https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O
$ bash Anaconda2-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh 
```

```sh
$ # For Python 3.6
$ curl https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O
$ bash Anaconda3-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

Let's Anaconda install itself in the default folder... (the goal is to do machine learning not managing Python environment)

```sh
$ /Users/gsempe/anaconda3
```
...and let it add itself to the PATH

```sh
Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda3 install location
to PATH in your /Users/gsempe/.bash_profile ? [yes|no]
[yes] >>> yes

Prepending PATH=/Users/gsempe/anaconda3/bin to PATH in /Users/gsempe/.bash_profile
A backup will be made to: /Users/gsempe/.bash_profile-anaconda3.bak


For this change to become active, you have to open a new terminal.

Thank you for installing Anaconda3!
